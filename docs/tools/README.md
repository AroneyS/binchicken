Tools
========

## Bin Chicken coassemble

[coassemble](/tools/coassemble) is the primary command used to cluster samples using unbinned single-copy marker genes and assemble/recover as suggested.

## Bin Chicken update

[update](/tools/update) allows you to apply further processing to a previous Bin Chicken run (e.g. actually running assembly/recovery, generating unmapped reads files, and/or downloading SRA reads).

## Bin Chicken iterate

[iterate](/tools/iterate) enables an iterative workflow, where new coassemblies are suggested, searching for novelty based on old and newly recovered bins.

## Bin Chicken evaluate

[evaluate](/tools/evaluate) is used to evaluate the targeting success of a Bin Chicken run.

## Bin Chicken build

[build](/setup) generates all dependency conda environments and sets environment variables. Ideal for first-time use.
